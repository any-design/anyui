# Migration from v0.0.56 to v0.1.0

## Style file importing

### Default theme

In previous version, the default theme will be imported by `default.css` or `default.scss`.

In v0.1.0, `default.scss` and `default.css` has been removed, you need to import `@any-design/anyui/styles/index.css` or the `index.scss` from the same folder.

```typescript
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import AnyUI from '@any-design/anyui';
// DON'T forget to import the style file
import '@any-design/anyui/styles/index.css'; // or '@any-design/anyui/styles/index.scss'

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(AnyUI);

app.mount('#app');
```

For customized theme, the `theme/vars.scss`, `theme/set.scss` are also removed in v0.1.0, now you need to import `@any-design/anyui/styles/theme.scss`.

It's the same for the users who using importing on demand, `@any-design/anyui/styles/theme.scss` (or `theme.css` from the same folder) is the only entry of all basic styles.

### Responsive styles

The responsive style file has been removed, the responsive style will be bundled to the component style, and will be enabled at default.

#### How to remove responsive styles

To remove all the responsive styles in the output, you can define a global SCSS var named `__anyui__enable-responsive-styles__` and set it to `false`.

This option WILL NOT work when you importing a pre-built CSS file.

## Theme customization

### Colors

The default colors has changed a little to fit dark mode better:

```
text: #323438 => #202426
text-disabled: #bcbdbf => #a0a1a4,
text-btn: #fff => #fdfdfe
```

### CSS Vars

If you're using `CSS Vars` for theme customization, there are some variables have been renamed:

```
var(--btn) => var(--text-btn)
var(--disabled) => var(--bg-disabled)
var(--readonly) => var(--bg-readonly)
```

### SCSS Vars

For the users using SCSS vars to customize the theme, the previous variables are no longer exist, you have to follow the instructions in [`Theme customization`](../theme/customization.md) document to rebuild your customization.

We've refactored our theme system based on color maps and generative styles, which can automatically generate the various colors for the dark mode and provides SCSS users with better and more powerful custom capabilities.
