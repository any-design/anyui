# Migration from v0.1.21 to v0.2.0

## Style file importing

### For users

In previous version, all the style definition of sub-components (like ASide, AHeader, AFooter, etc.) will be combined into one style file, it will be associated to the root component while importing by resolver.

Now in `v0.2.0`, we allow you to import the style file of sub-components seperately.

For example, in previous version, the importing looks like:

```typescript
import ASide from '@any-design/anyui';
import '@any-design/anyui/styles/components/layout.scss';
```

Now it will be:

```typescript
import ASide from '@any-design/anyui';
import '@any-design/anyui/styles/components/side.scss';
```

Affected components:

```html
<a-side></a-side>
<a-header></a-header>
<a-footer></a-footer>
<a-content></a-content>
<a-list-menu-item></a-list-menu-item>
<a-list-view-item></a-list-view-item>
```

### For contributors

Due to the new generation methods in `v0.2.0` will generate a single style file for sub-component, it's important to give every sub-component a unique name.

Also, never write the style of a sub-component in its root-component, if users only import the sub-comopnent, the styles might be broken.
