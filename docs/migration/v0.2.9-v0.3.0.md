# Migration from v0.2.9 to v0.3.0

## Virtual list

We removed `keyType` and `reuseNode` properties in `v0.3.0` to ensure this component will not behave out of our expectation.

In previous version, we found that in some specific use cases, reuse some DOM nodes or preserve the rendered component will cause some malicious issues (state and watchers in the component will not act as expected).

You should double check the behaviour of `AVirtualList` in your use case after upgrade, and remove these properties if you already used them.
